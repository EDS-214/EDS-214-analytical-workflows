## Files and directories

In the following code examples, you need to type the command, but not include 
the command prompt (e.g., `brun@taylor:~$`) which just shows that the computer 
is ready to accept a command.

We'll start by:

- creating two directories with `mkdir` (make directory)
- create a simple text file using `echo`
- Show the contents of that file using `cat` (concatenate)

```bash
brun@taylor:~$ mkdir oss
brun@taylor:~$ mkdir oss/data
brun@taylor:~$ echo "# Tutorial files related to OSS" > oss/README.md
brun@taylor:~$ cat oss/README.md
# Tutorial files related to OSS
brun@taylor:~$ 
```

Next, let's copy another file and look around in the directories:

- copy a file into your directory with `cp` (copy)
- change our working directory to that newly created directory using `cd` (change directory)
- list the files in the directory with `ls` (list)
- look where we are in the filesystem using `pwd` (print working directory)
- get an overview of the directory contents using `tree`


```bash
brun@taylor:~$ cd ~
brun@taylor:~$ cp 10min-loop.R oss
brun@taylor:~$ cd oss
brun@taylor:~/oss$ ls
10min-loop.R  data  README.md
brun@taylor:~/oss$ pwd
/home/brun/oss
```

Now, let's create two subdirectories in the data directory: `mammals` and `plots`

- move using `cp` all the mammals files from the `sampledata` folder to the `mammals` subdirectory; hint: you can use the wildcard `*`
- move using `mv` the other files files from the `sampledata` folder to the `plots` subdirectory
- double check it is done using `cd` and `ls`
- remove `rm` the  `sampledata` directory; hint: `rmdir` can only remove empty directories
- bonus: add a text file `data_listing.txt` in the `data` folder that lists all the files in it
