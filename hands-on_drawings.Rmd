```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Goal

**Combine 4 datasets about stream flow and water chemistry in a way that will let you investigate the impact of the 1989 Hurricane Hugo on Stream Chemistry in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico**


### A few things to know:

- Table structures are different => only some variables / columns overlap maong teh different sites
- Units used among the various sites are different
- Period covered is not perfectly aligned for all the time-series. Some sites start or end before others, but there is a period of overlap




### Study sites

```{r map}
knitr::include_graphics("img/luq-map-small.png")
```

### Output

We want to be able to produce this plot
```{r plot}
knitr::include_graphics("img/luq-ts-plot.png")
```

**Draw the data processing steps and You want to harmonize those data into one dataset that will let you compare time-series data (20min)**
