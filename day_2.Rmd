# GitHub branches

## Collaborating through write / push access

When you collaborate closely and actively with colleagues, you do not want necessarily to have to review all their changes through pull requests. You can then give them write access (`git push`) to your repository to allow them to directly edit and contribute to its content. This is the workflow we will recommend to use within your working group.

#### Adding collaborators to a repository 

* Click on the repository
* On the top tabs, click ![](img/github-repo-settings.png)
* On the left pane, click `Manage access` and click on "Invite a Collaborator" to enter the usernames you want to add

![collaborators](img/github-collaborators.png) 

Under this collaborative workflow, we recommend to use git `branches` combined with pull requests to avoid conflicts and to track and discuss collaborators contributions.

# Branches

![adapted from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge](img/atlassian_branches_sketch.png)

What are branches?  Well in fact nothing new, as the `master` is a branch. A branch represents an independent line of development, parallel to the master (branch). 

Why should you use branches? For 2 main reasons:

* We want the master to only keep a version of the code that is working
* We want to version the code we are developing to add/test new features (for now we mostly talk about feature branch) in our script without altering the version on the master.

## Working with branches

### Creating a new branch

In RStudio, you can create a branch using the git tab. 

1. Click on the branch button

```{r RStudio git pane branch, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-git-branch-create.png")
```

2. Fill the branch name in the new branch window; in this example, we are going to use `test` for the name; leave the other options as default and click create 

```{r RStudio git new branch window, out.width='40%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-git-branch-test.png")
```

3. you will be directly creating a local and remote branch and switch to it

```{r RStudio git new branch, out.width='62%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-git-branch-new.png")
```

Congratulations you just created your first branch! 

Let us check on Github:

```{r RStudio github new branch, out.width='45%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-new-branch.png")
```

As you can see, now there are two branches on our remote repository: 
- master
- test

### Using a branch

Here there is nothing new. The workflow is exactly the same as we did before, except our commits will be created on the `test` branch instead of the master branch.


## GitHub Hands-on 

In this section we will be using the GitHub.com website and show you do not need to be a programmer to use version control and edit files on GitHub!

Checks:
If you have not already created a GitHub username, please do so now:
- GitHub: https://github.com
- Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)


### Our asks

As a Team of two:
- Help each other, everyone is bringing different skills! Talk it out!
- Listen to each other; avoid judgment and solutioneering.
- Have fun!

### Prompt 

#### Person 1 (owner):

- Create a (first) repository following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) steps 1-6

![](img/github-dessert-repo.png)

- Add Person 2 as collaborator following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

#### Person 2: Modify a file

- Check your email to accept the invitation
- Go to the repository website (link is provided in the invitation)
- Click on pen at the top of the README.md file to edit it

![](img/github-readme-edit.png)


- Replace the title (first line starting with `#`) with something better! Maybe `Favorite Desserts`
- Add your name and your favorite dessert below the title: e.g.  ` - Julien: crepes`
- Add a descriptive message

![](img/github-commit.png)
- Commit your changes

```{r commit-button, out.width="20%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-commit-button.png")
```


#### Person 1: add a file

Download this [csv file](https://aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu/~brun/favorite_desserts.csv) about your favorite desserts to your computer

- Just drag and drop it on the Github web page of your repository to upload it
- Add a short message about the file e.g. `Adding dessert csv` & hit `Commit changes`
- Your have has been uploaded. Click on the filename to see it!

You should have something similar to this repo: https://github.com/brunj7/favorite-desserts

#### Bonus Person 2:

Try to edit the csv file directly on GitHub!
