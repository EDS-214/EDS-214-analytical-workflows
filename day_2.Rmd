# Git Therapy

## GitHub conflicts

First thing to know is that actually `git pull` (or a Pull Request) is a two step process: `git pull = git fetch + git merge`

Second: you did nothing wrong!! Git tries to merge files automatically. When the changes are on the same file far apart, git will figure it out on his own and do the merge automatically. However if changes are overlapping, `git` will call you to the rescue and ask him how to solve the problem.
