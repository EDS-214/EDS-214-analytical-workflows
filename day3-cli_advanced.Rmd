# Advanced Topics at the command line

**We will not cover this during class, it is for your reference**. You will also have the opportunity to further practice and learn about the command line in EDS-215.

## Connecting to a remote server via `ssh`

From the gitbash (MS Windows) or the terminal (Mac) type:

```bash
ssh taylor.bren.ucsb.edu
```
You will be prompted for your username and password.

You can also directly add your username:

```bash
ssh brun@taylor.bren.ucsb.edu
```

In this case, you will be only asked for your password as you already specified which user you want to connect with.



## Unix systems are multi-user
* Who else is logged into this machine?  `who`
* Who is logged into "this shell"?  `whoami`



## Getting help

* `<command> -h`, `<command> --help`
* `man`, `info`, `apropos`, `whereis`
* Search the web!


## finding stuff

Show me my Rmarkdown files!

```bash
find . -iname '*.Rmd'
```

Which files are larger than 1GB?

```bash
find . -size +1G
```
With more details about the files:

```bash
find . -size +1G -ls
```


## Getting things done

### Some useful, special commands using the Control key

* Cancel (abort) a command: `Ctrl-c`  Note: very different than Windows!!
* Stop (suspend) a command: `Ctrl-z`
* `Ctrl-z` can be used to suspend, then background a process


### Process management

* Like Windows Task Manager, OSX Activity Monitor
* **`top`**, `ps`, `jobs` (hit `q` to get out!)
* `kill` to delete an unwanted job or process
* Foreground and background: `&`


### What about "space"

* How much storage is available on this system?  `df -h`
* How much storage am "I" using overall?  `du -hs <folder>`
* How much storage am "I" using, by sub directory?  `du -h <folder>`

### History

* See your command history:  `history`
* Re-run last command:  `!!`  (pronounced "bang-bang")
* Re-run 32th command: `!32`
* Re-run 5th from last command: `!-5`
* Re-run last command that started with 'c': `!c`


## A sampling of simple commands for dealing with files

* `wc` count lines, words, and/or characters
* `diff` compare two files for differences
* `sort` sort lines in a file
* `uniq` report or filter out repeated lines in a file


## Get into the flow, with pipes 

![`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`](img/pipe_split.png
    "http://www.ucblueash.edu/thomas/Intro_Unix_Text/Images/pipe_split.png")

```bash
$ ls *.png | wc -l
$ ls *.png | wc -l > pngcount.txt
$ diff <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)
$ ls foo 2>/dev/null
```

* note use of `*` as character wildcard for zero or more matches (same in Mac and Windows)
* `?` matches single character; `_` is SQL query equivalent


## Text editing

### Some editors

* `vim`
* `emacs`
* `nano`

```bash
$ nano .bashrc
```

## Searching advanced utilities

* `grep` search files for text
* `sed` filter and transform text
* `find` advanced search for files/directories


### grep

Show all lines containing "bug" in my R scripts

```bash
$ grep bug *.R
```

Now count the number of occurrences per file

```bash
$ grep -c bug *.R
```

Print the names of files that contain bug

```bash
$ grep -l bug *.R
```

### Let's look at our text file

*  `cat` print file(s)
*  `head` print first few lines of file(s)
*  `tail` print last few lines of file(s)
*  `less` "pager" -- view file interactively (type `q` to quit command)
*  `od --t` "octal dump" -- to view file's underlying binary/octal/hexadecimal/ASCII format

## Create custom commands with "alias"
```alias lwc='ls *.jpg | wc -l'```

You can create a number of custom aliases that are available whenever you log in, by putting commands such as the above in your shell start-up file, e.g. `.bashrc`
