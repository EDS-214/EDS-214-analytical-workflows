```


# Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

- How to connect to a remote server 
- Get familiar with RStudio server
- Get a short introduction to the command line (CLI)


# Why working on a remote machine?

Often the main motivation is to **scale your analysis beyond what a personal computer can handle**. R being pretty memory intensive, moving to a server often provides you more RAM and thus allows to load larger data in R without the need of slicing your data into chunks. But there are also other advantages, here are the main for scientist:

* **Power**: More *CPUs/Cores* (24/32/48), More RAM (256/384GB) 
* **Capacity**: More *disk space* and generally *faster storage* (in highly optimized RAID arrays)
* **Security**: Data are spread across *multiple drives* and have nightly *backups*
* **Collaboration**: *shared folders* for code, data, and other materials; same *software versions*

# RStudio Server

From an user perspective, _RStudio Server is your familiar RStudio interface in your web browser_. The big difference however is that with RStudio Server the computation will be running on the remote machine instead of your local personal computer. This also means that **the files you are seeing through the RStudio Server interface are located on the remote machine. And this also include your R packages!!!** This remote file management is the main change you will have to adopt in your workflow. 

To help with remote files management, the RStudio Server interface as few additional features that we will be discussing in the following sections.

```{r RStudio Server, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align="center"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-server-ide.png")
```

## Connecting to MEDS Analytical Server

1. Got to: <https://taylor.bren.ucsb.edu/> 

2. Enter your credentials

3. You are in!

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-server_login.png")
```

4. Click on the `New Session` button. You can see that you are able to start both an R (Studio) and jupyter notebook session. Let's take a few minutes to experiment with the different options. 

For this session, we are going to select the `RStudio` option and hit `Start Session`.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-server_session.png")
```

**You should now see a very familiar interface :)  Except it is running on the server with a lot of resources at your fingertips!!**

### File structure

Let's explore explore a little bit the file structure on the server. By default on a Linux server, you are located in the `home` folder. This folder is only accessible to you and it is where you can store your personal files on a server. You should see 2 folders: `R` and `H`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-server_file-structure.png")
```

The `R` folder is where your local R packages will be installed, you can ignore it. The `H` is your H drive that the Bren School is offering to all its students. If you click on it you should see any files you have uploaded there.

Let us make a folder named `github` by click on the `New Folder` button at the top of the tab. We will use this folder (also named `directory` in linux/unix terms) to clone any GitHub repository.

### R packages

If we go to the `Packages` tab, we can see a long list of packages that have already be installed by our system administrator (Brad). Those packages have been installed server wide, meaning that all the users have access to them. 


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-server_packages.png")
```


A user can also installed her/his own packages. Let's try to install the `remote` package that lets you install R packages directly from GitHub: `install.packages("remotes")`. Once done, note a new section that appeared on the Packages tab named `User Library`. Each of us have now its own copy of the package installed (in this `R` folder we were talking about a few minutes ago). 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-server_packages-user.png")
```

A few notes:

- In this example we will have made a better choice to have the `remotes` package installed once at the system level
- Some R packages depend on external libraries that need to be installed on the server. Those libraries will have to be installed by the system administrator first before you can install the R package
- Installing an R package on a linux machine generally requires compilation of the code and will thus take more time to install than when you install it from pre-compiled binaries

**Look now inside you `R` folder!!**

# Command line

## Introduction to UNIX and its siblings

UNIX
 :  Originally developed at AT&T Bell Labs circa 1970. Has
     experienced a [long, multi-branched
     evolutionary path](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg)

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)
 :  a set of specifications of what an OS needs to qualify as "a Unix", to enhance interoperability among all the "Unix" variants


#### Various Unices

![The unix family tree](img/unix-history-simple.png)

* OS X
 :  [is a Unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/is-mac-os-x-unix)!
* Linux
 :  is _not_ fully POSIX-compliant, but certainly can be
      regarded as [functionally Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)
      

### Some Unix hallmarks

* Supports multi-users, multi-processes
* Highly modular: many small tools that do one thing well, and can be combined
* Culture of text files and streams
* Primary OS on HPC (**High Performance Computing** Systems)
* Main OS on which Internet was built

    
## The Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides a direct way to interact with the Operating System, by typing in commands. 

### Why the CLI is worth learning

* Might be the only interface you have to a High Performance Computer (HPC)
* Command statements can be reused easily and saved as scripts
* Easier automation and text files manipulation

Not convinced? Check this out: [the CLI pitch](https://brunj7.github.io/eds214-handson-cli/cli-pitch.html)
      
### A little bit of terminology

- `Command Line Interface (CLI)`: This is a user interface that lets you interact with a computer. It is a legacy from the early days of computers. Now a days computers have graphical user interfaces instead (MacOSX, Windows, Linux, ...) 
- `Terminal`: It is a an application that lets you run a command line interface. It used to be a physical machine connected to a mainframe computer
- `Shell`: It is the program that runs the command line. There are many different shells, the most common (an default on most system) being `bash` (Bourne Again SHell)



### The Terminal from RStudio

You can access the command line directly from RStudio by using the `Terminal` tab next to your R console.

![](img/rstudio-terminal.png)


### Navigating and managing files/directories in *NIX


![](img/unix_filetree.gif)

* `pwd`: Know where you are
* `ls`: List the content of the directory
* `cd`: Go inside a directory

Some pseudo directory names. Wherever you are:

* `~` : Home directory
* `.` : Here (current directory)
* `..`: Up one level (upper directory)

Let's put this into action: 

* go to my "Home" directory:  `cd ~`
* go up one directory level: `cd ..`
* list the content: `ls`
* list the content showing hidden files: `ls -a`  note that `-a` is referred as an option (modifies the command)
 
More files/directories manipulations:

* `mkdir`: Create a directory
* `cp`: Copy a file
* `mv`: Move a file  **it is also how you rename a file!**
* `rm` / `rmdir`: Remove a file / directory  **use those carefully, there is no return / Trash!!**


**Note: typing is not your thing? the `<tab>` key is your friend!** One hit it will auto-complete the file/directory/path name for you. If there are many options, hit it twice to see the options.


### Permissions

All files have permissions and ownership.

![File permissions](img/UnixFileLongFormat.png)

* List files showing ownership and permissions: `ls -l`

```bash
brun@taylor:/courses/EDS214$ ls -l
total 16
drwxrwxr-x+ 3 brun      esmdomainusers 4096 Aug 20 04:49 data
drwxrwxr-x+ 2 katherine esmdomainusers 4096 Aug 18 18:32 example	
```

You can change those permissions:

* Change permissions: `chmod`
* Change ownership: `chown`


::: {.callout-tip}
Clear contents in terminal window: `clear`
:::


## General command syntax

* `command [options] [arguments]`

where `command` must be an _executable_ file on your `PATH`
* `echo $PATH`

and `options` can usually take two forms
* short form: `-a`
* long form: `--all`

You can combine the options:

```bash
ls -ltrh
```

What do these options do?

```bash
man ls
```

::: {.callout-tip}
hit `spacebar` to get to the next page of the manual
hit `q` to exit the help
:::

## Getting things done

### Some useful, special commands using the Control key

* Cancel (abort) a command: `Ctrl-c`  Note: very different than Windows!!
* Stop (suspend) a command: `Ctrl-z`
* `Ctrl-z` can be used to suspend, then background a process


### Process management

* Like Windows Task Manager, OSX Activity Monitor
* **`top`**, `ps`, `jobs` (hit `q` to get out!)
* `kill` to delete an unwanted job or process
* Foreground and background: `&`


### What about "space"

* How much storage is available on this system?  `df -h`
* How much storage am "I" using overall?  `du -hs <folder>`
* How much storage am "I" using, by sub directory?  `du -h <folder>`
* How much RAM is used?  `free -h`


### Existential questions

* What is your username?  `whoami`
* What is today's date?  `date`
* Where are the programs you are using?   `whereis R` also try `which -a python`
* What is the kernel version of your OS:  `uname -a`
* Since when since last reboot: `uptime`



### History

* See your command history:  `history`
* Re-run last command:  `!!`  (pronounced "bang-bang")
* Re-run 32th command: `!32`
* Re-run 5th from last command: `!-5`
* Re-run last command that started with 'c': `!c`


## A sampling of simple commands for dealing with files

* `wc` count lines, words, and/or characters
* `diff` compare two files for differences
* `sort` sort lines in a file
* `uniq` report or filter out repeated lines in a file


## Get into the flow, with pipes 

![`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`](img/pipe_split.png
    "http://www.ucblueash.edu/thomas/Intro_Unix_Text/Images/pipe_split.png")


```bash
wc -l *.csv 
wc -l *.csv | sort -n
```

:::{callout-tip}
- note use of `*` as character wildcard for zero or more matches (same in Mac and Windows)
- `?` matches single character;
:::


Here the `wc -l` command, which counts the number of lines in files,
is given filenames on the command line, so it counts the lines in
those files.  It writes its output to stdout.  `sort -n` sorts lines
in files.  It was given no files to sort, so it sorts whatever lines
come in via stdin.  By piping these together (i.e., by hooking `wc`'s
stdout to `sort`'s stdin using the pipe operator), the output from `wc
-l` is thereby sorted.

There are various operators for redirecting where stdin comes from and
where stdout and stderr go:

- `< file`: read stdin from file
- `> file`: write stdout to file
- `2> file`: write stderr to file
- `>& file`: write both stdout and stderr to file
- `>> file`: append stdout to file


Let's write the above result to a file:

```bash
wc -l *.csv | sort -n > csvcount.txt
```

Caution: except for `>>`, all forms of `>` are destructive: Bash
overwrites any existing file with an empty file before the program is
run.

Want to get rid of output you don't want to see?  Use the Unix black
hole: `>& /dev/null`.  (This is a cultural meme, you'll see it on
T-shirts and license plates.)

The above are the main redirections, but there are others.

### [**CLI Practice**](https://github.com/brunj7/eds214-handson-cli)


**To end a session, simply type `exit` or `logout` into the command line**

# Collaborative Setup

There are additional reasons of particular importance in a collaborative set up, such as a working group:

- **Centralizing data management**: As you know synthesis science is data intensive and often require to deal with a large number of heterogeneous data files. It can be complicated to make sure every collaborators as access to all the data they need. It is even harder to ensure that the exact same version of the data is used by everyone. Moving your workflow to a server, will allow to have only one copy of the data that you can share with all your collaborators. Even better, since everyone can access the same data, everybody will have the exact same path in their script!!

- **Make sure your files are safe**: Generally, servers are managed by a System Administrator. This person is in charge of keeping the server up-to-date, secured from malwares and set up back up strategies to ensure all the files on the server are backed up. When using cloud solutions, you should always check if a back up plan is available for the resources your using.


# What does working on a remote server mean?

What does it mean for your workflow? The good news is that RStudio Server makes it very easy for RStudio users to start using a server for their analysis. The main changes are  about:

- **File management**: you will need to learn to move files (including your R scripts) to the server
- **R Package installation**: You can still install the R packages you need under your user (with some limitations). However some R packages will be already installed at the server level.

# Uploading Files to a server

You have several options to upload files to the server. Some are more convenient if you have few files, like RStudio interface, some are more built for uploading a lot of files at one, like specific software... and you guessed it the CLI :)

### RStudio

You can only upload one file at the time (you can zip a folder to trick it):

![](img/rstudio-upload.png)

## sFTP Software

An efficient protocol to upload files is FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The `s` stands for secured. Any software supporting those protocols will work to transfer files. 

We recommend the following free software:

- Mac users: [cyberduck]( https://cyberduck.io)
- Windows: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

![](img/server-cyberduck.png)

## scp

The `scp` command is another convenient way to transfer a single file or directory using the CLI. You can run it from Taylor or from your local computer. Here is the basic syntax:

```
scp /source/path hostname:/path/to/destination/
```

Here is an example of my uploading the file `10min-loop.R` to Taylor from my laptop. The destination directory on Taylor is `/Users/brun/`:

```bash
scp 10min-loop.R brun@taylor.bren.ucsb.edu:/Users/brun/
```

BTW try to open and run that script for fun!!


If you want to upload an entire folder, you can add the `-r` option to the command. The general syntax is:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/source-folder user@server:/path/to/destination-folder/
```


Here is an example uploading all the images in the `myplot` folder 

```bash
scp -r myplot brun@taylor.bren.ucsb.edu:/Users/brun/plots
```

# A few words about vim

This section is optional depending of our progress and interest. Vim is still the defautl text editor on many Linux distribution and it is good to know about its basics.
