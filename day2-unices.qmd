## Introduction to UNIX and its siblings

UNIX
 :  Originally developed at AT&T Bell Labs circa 1970. Has
     experienced a [long, multi-branched
     evolutionary path](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg)

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)
 :  a set of specifications of what an OS needs to qualify as "a Unix", to enhance interoperability among all the "Unix" variants


#### Various Unices

* OS X
 :  [is a Unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/is-mac-os-x-unix)!
* Linux
 :  is _not_ fully POSIX-compliant, but certainly can be
      regarded as [functionally Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)
      

### Some Unix hallmarks

* Supports multi-users, multi-processes
* Highly modular: many small tools that do one thing well, and can be combined
* Culture of text files and streams
* Primary OS on HPC (**High Performance Computing** Systems)
* Main OS on which Internet was built
