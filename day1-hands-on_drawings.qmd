## Goal

**Draw the workflow to combine 4 datasets about stream flow and water chemistry in a way that will let you investigate the impact of the 1989 Hurricane Hugo on Stream Chemistry in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico**


### A few things to know:

- Table structures are different => only some variables / columns overlap among the different sites
- Units used among the various sites are different
- Period covered is not perfectly aligned for all the time-series. Some sites start or end before others, but there is a period of overlap




### Study sites

```{r map, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/luq-map-small.png")
```

### Output

We want to be able to produce this plot

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/luq-ts-plot.png")
```
# To Do:

**Draw the data processing steps to harmonize those data into one dataset that will let you compare time-series data and reproduce the above plot (20min)**

I recommend you use the white boards or paper. You can also use <https://excalidraw.com/> (but do not take too much time to learn all its features! Focus on developing the workflow)

## Remember

- Each **node** represents a `step` or an `input/output`
- Each connecting **edge** represents data flow or processing
