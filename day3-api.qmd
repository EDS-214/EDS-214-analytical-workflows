## The manual way

Using website to retrieve data is great interactive way to search and explore data of interest. Let's start our day by searching some data on the data repository DateONE: <https://search.dataone.org/data>

In case you need some inspiration, look at this dataset about historic precipitation in Alaska: <https://doi.org/10.5063/N29VCQ>

Although discovering data through a web interface is convenient and offers a great experience, it is often hard to scale this approach or to integrate it into a reproducible workflow.
