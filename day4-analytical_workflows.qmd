## Analytical workflow frameworks in R


### Targets

The `targets` R package can be very useful if you have a complex workflow that is built of many parts that take time to rerun. Target can detect and run only the strict necessary steps to rerun when a specific change has been done to the workflow.

### Pointblank

Although the `pointblank` package is mainly framed as a validating tool of the various part of your workflow, it provide a set of tools and great integration with the R Markdown ecosystem. It is also quite flexible making it possible to leverage this tool in a variety of project setups.
