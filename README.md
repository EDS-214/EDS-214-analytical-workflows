## Course description

The generation and analysis of environmental data is often a complex, multi-step process that may involve the collaboration of many people. Increasingly tools that document help to organize and document workflows are being used to ensure reproducibility and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to the conceptual organization of workflows as a way to conduct reproducible analyses, as well as various software tools that help users to manage multi-step processes that require tools for storing, managing and sharing workflows, code, documents and data.
