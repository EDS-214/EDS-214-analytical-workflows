# Collaborative Setup

There are additional reasons of particular importance in a collaborative set up, such as a working group:

- **Centralizing data management**: As you know synthesis science is data intensive and often require to deal with a large number of heterogeneous data files. It can be complicated to make sure every collaborators as access to all the data they need. It is even harder to ensure that the exact same version of the data is used by everyone. Moving your workflow to a server, will allow to have only one copy of the data that you can share with all your collaborators. Even better, since everyone can access the same data, everybody will have the exact same path in their script!!

- **Make sure your files are safe**: Generally, servers are managed by a System Administrator. This person is in charge of keeping the server up-to-date, secured from malwares and set up back up strategies to ensure all the files on the server are backed up. When using cloud solutions, you should always check if a back up plan is available for the resources your using.


# What does working on a remote server mean?

What does it mean for your workflow? The good news is that RStudio Server makes it very easy for RStudio users to start using a server for their analysis. The main changes are  about:

- **File management**: you will need to learn to move files (including your R scripts) to the server
- **R Package installation**: You can still install the R packages you need under your user (with some limitations). However some R packages will be already installed at the server level.
