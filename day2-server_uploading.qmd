title: "Uploading things to a server"

You have several options to upload files to the server. Some are more convenient if you have few files, like RStudio interface, some are more built for uploading a lot of files at one, like specific software... and you guessed it the CLI :)

### RStudio

You can only upload one file at the time (you can zip a folder to trick it):

## sFTP Software

An efficient protocol to upload files is FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The `s` stands for secured. Any software supporting those protocols will work to transfer files. 

We recommend the following free software:

- Mac users: [cyberduck]( https://cyberduck.io)
- Windows: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

## scp

The `scp` command is another convenient way to transfer a single file or directory using the CLI. You can run it from Taylor or from your local computer. Here is the basic syntax:

```
scp /source/path hostname:/path/to/destination/
```

Here is an example of my uploading the file `10min-loop.R` to Taylor from my laptop. The destination directory on Taylor is `/Users/brun/`:

```bash
scp 10min-loop.R brun@taylor.bren.ucsb.edu:/Users/brun/
```

BTW try to open and run that script for fun!!


If you want to upload an entire folder, you can add the `-r` option to the command. The general syntax is:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/source-folder user@server:/path/to/destination-folder/
```


Here is an example uploading all the images in the `myplot` folder 

```bash
scp -r myplot brun@taylor.bren.ucsb.edu:/Users/brun/plots
```
