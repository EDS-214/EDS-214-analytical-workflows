# The power of README

README are not a new thing. They have been around computer projects since the early days. One great thing about the popularization of supporting the markdown syntax and its web rendering in most code repositories, is that you can move beyond a simple text file and start to present a compelling entry point to your project that can link to various parts and external resources.



# Code Commenting

***Real Programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.*** \
Tom Van Vleck, based on people he knew (https://multicians.org/thvv/realprogs.html)
