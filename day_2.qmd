# Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

-   How to connect to a remote server
-   Get familiar with RStudio server
-   Get a short introduction to the command line (CLI)

## Why working on a remote machine?

Often the main motivation is to **scale your analysis beyond what a personal computer can handle**. R being pretty memory intensive, moving to a server often provides you more RAM and thus allows to load larger data in R without the need of slicing your data into chunks. But there are also other advantages, here are the main for scientist:

-   **Power**: More *CPUs/Cores* (24/32/48), More RAM (256/384GB)
-   **Capacity**: More *disk space* and generally *faster storage* (in highly optimized RAID arrays)
-   **Security**: Data are spread across *multiple drives* and have nightly *backups*
-   **Collaboration**: *shared folders* for code, data, and other materials; same *software versions*
